[**Alabaster**](https://github.com/tonsky/sublime-scheme-alabaster) is a minimal theme that highlights code very selectively by design. It makes comments stand out more than most themes, on the basis that they include important documentation. It was created by Niki Tonsky, who has outlined the thinking behind it in [a blog post](https://tonsky.me/blog/syntax-highlighting/).

This Nova port contains light and dark versions of the basic Alabaster theme, which are shown below.
